    <h1 id="My 2020">My 2020</h1>
    <p><span class='hashtag'>#blog</span> </p>
  
    <p>2020 was a very different year for all of us.  The COVID 19 Virus dominated all of our lives.  We stayed pretty much barricaded in r house most of the year after March 11, the day everything changed. To read a good oral history of that day   <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/an-oral-history-of-the-day-everything-changed-coronavirus/">Click Here</a></p>
  
    <h2 id="Books">Books</h2>
    <p>Since  we all spent much of the year art home I read  many  books this year - 37 to be exact.  Five of my favorites:  </p>
    <br>
    <ul><li><i>Atomic Habits</i>	by James Clear - not your typical productivity book.  Doesn’t  stress goals but targets developing habits.
    </li><li><i>Genius -  Richard Feynman</i> by James Gleck, the same guy who wrote <i>Chaos</i> a book I loved years ago.  For those of you who never head of Feynman he was as responsible as anyone for the bombs we dropped to end WWII
    </li><li><i>The Overstory</i> by Richard Powers - if i had to pick the best book of the year this is the one.  The story of 5 trees and 9 people is a spellbinding narrative for those of us that appreciate Nature
    </li><li>The <i>Brother Gardeners</i>  - If you are a gardener and can read you will probably be interested in <i>The Brother  Gardeners: Botany, Empire and the Birth of an Obsession</i> by Andrea Wulf. brings to life the dramas and dangers of eighteenth-century plant collecting.
    </li></ul>
    <p>W. I. Warsawski is a series of books about a female Private Eye in Chicago by Sara Paretesky.  Sara started writing the series in 1982 and has published close to 20 books in this series with the last being in 2020.  I’ve read them all.  Part of my fascination is because they all take place in Chicago.  I recognize most of the locations mentioned in the books.  I’d recommend the series anyway if you like mystery novels but doubly recommend them if you’’ve lived in Chicago.</p>

    <h2 id="Exercise">Exercise</h2>
    <p>Moving on from books since we were all marooned at home we  exercised a lot.  Walking outside was one of the few relatively safe activities.   We also did the Orange Theory at home workouts. In addition to all that I rode my bicycle more than I had in years.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After the COVID infection rates went down in the Summer we started back at the OTF facility</p>

<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Even though COVID was starting to worsen we decided to travel to Sedona   to hike some trails, dine at a couple of local favorite restaurants, and escape from home for a few days.</p>
<br>
<p>Sedona was pretty crowded.  Apparently many other had the same thought process.  However there are so many hiking trails in the area its not difficult to maintain a safe distance from other people.  The restaurants all practiced  good COVID safety measures. The staff all wore masks and the tables were a good distance apart.    Phoenix was likewise. </p>
<br>
<p>The one scary part of the trip was the airport. The trip from DFW was no problem.  Both airports were fairly deserted.  We scheduled our trip home the day before Thanksgiving which was stupid on our part.  Sky Harbor was pretty empty when we arrived for our flight but by the time we boarded the plane the terminal was jam packed with people.  Fortunately we arrived home without contracting the dreaded virus</p>
<br>
<p>Our typical day was breakfast in the timeshare, take a hike, lunch somewhere, take a hike, dinner somewhere.  One day we did drive to Prescott via Jerome because the drive is very scenic and our son drove over that pass one winter during a snowstorm.  We just have to see for ourselves what it was like.</p>
<br>
<p>We stayed in Phoenix Hotels the first and last night.</p>

<p>Flew to Phoenix. Flight was uneventful.  The airport was “different”. We walked forever to get to the baggage.  Then a 10 minute ride to the rental car.</p>
<br>
<p>Once we have a car we drive back to and through the airport on our way to the hotel in Scottsdale.  We are staying at the Element at Skysong.</p>
<br>
<p>Dinner at <b>Olive and Ivy</b> near Old Town Scottsdale.  Very good with lots of social distancing. Very important in this season of surging COVID.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nov 21, 2020 at 8:16 PM:</p>
<p>Slept in this morning until 7.  Tried to find Wildflower Bread Company which we remembered from our Sedona Visits.  I set Google Maps to the location in the Airport.  We were almost there when we realized my mistake.  So we stopped and re-programmed Google for another location.  Unfortunately this was not quite the same as the Sedona Wildflower. Only a few plain bagels.  However, Gwen found a lunch sandwich she could eat.  My breakfast was good but if you are yearning for bagels don’t stop at Wildflower.  Then back to the hotel to freshen up and checkout.  </p>
<br>
<p>We walked around and drove around the old town Scottsdale neighborhood until noon. Then we lunched at <b>Craft 64</b>. It was basically a craft beer and pizza joint close to old town Scottsdale.  I loved it. They had two Porters!  Pizza was good Neopolitan Pizza, just not quite as thin as New York Style.</p>
<br>
<p>Next we drove to Sedona, checked in at the Wyndham, bought some groceries at the Safeway, ate dinner in the condo while watching Saturday Night Football.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nov 22, 2020 at 8:28 AM:  Slept in until 7:30 this morning.  Breakfast in the condo.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nov 22, 2020 at 12:21 PM:  Hike the <b>Fay Canyon Trail</b> this morning</p>
<img class="img75Percent" src="./photos/SedonaTrail.jpg">
<hr>
<p>Nov 22, 2020 at 8:04 PM:  Hiked again this afternoon. Then back to the condo to clean up. Dinner at <b>Cucina Rustica</b> in Oak Creek. Now it and <b>Elote</b> tie for the best meal experience in Sedona.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nov 23, 2020 at 7:49 PM:  slept in until 7. Breakfast in the condo. A little cooler today high 40s at 8.  Read a bit</p>
<p>Around 10 headed out to <b>Tuzigoot National Monument</b>. Another Native American set of structures on high ground with great views in all directions.  Not cliff dwellings like Chaco Canyon or Mesa Verde but similar construction stone with clay mortar.  Could these be more of the mysterious Anasazi? No one is sure but there are plenty opinions among archeologists for and against.</p>
<br>
<p>Then we drove up through <b>Jerome</b>, over the mountains, to Prescott retracing, the famous among our family, Andy and Kara trek during a snowstorm to bypass the closed Interstate 40 on their way to visit Sara in Santa Barbara and the Rose Bowl.</p>
<br>
<p>We had lunch at <b>The Local Restaurant</b> in Prescott. It was converted from something else in an aging strip mall kinda off the beaten path.  The sort of place you would find aging Hippies hanging out.  However, the food was excellent. A winner if you are ever In Prescott.  By the way Prescott is a pretty big place and it is spread out.  Seemed to go on forever.</p>
<br>
<p>After lunch we drove to hike around <b>Lynx Lake</b> in Prescott National Forest. An enjoyable leisurely walk around the lake with very few people also hiking unlike yesterday.</p>
<br>
<p>Dinner at the <b>Golden Goose</b>.  Appears it’s been in Sedona forever.  The interior reminded me of a semi upscale small steakhouse from the 1950s. The waitress was a little weird but the food was top flight.  They had an extensive menu with meat, fish, and salad.  Still reminding me of the 1950s.  I had meatloaf and Gwen had the pork chop.  Receives the Olson seal of approval.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nov 25, 2020 at 3:22 PM</p>
<p>November 24:  slept in again. Breakfast in the condo. Then we packed and drove to <b>Montezuma’s Castle</b> which is an Indian Pueblo built into the side of a limestone cliff.  </p>
<br>
<p><bold>Montezuma’s Castle</bold> was very interesting and well worth the stop.  The Castle is located in a canyon where a meandering stream runs through - Beaver Creek.  There are many flora worth studying there. My favorite was the Arizona Elm.  </p>
<img class="img90Percent" src="./photos/MontezumasCastle.jpg">
<br> <br>
<p>Checked in Residence Inn Salt Creek Scottsdale. Awesome hotel, stay there the nicer time in Phoenix. </p>
<br>
<p>Lunch at the hotels with some of our goodies</p>
<br>
<p>Hike in the afternoon at one of the many Phoenix trails around the mountains that spring up here and there around the city</p>
<br>
<p>Dinner at <b>Rostino’s</b>. It’s chain mostly in the Mountain Time Zone that’s sort of l;Ike a neighborhood bar.  Besides drinks the food fare is mostly salads and Paninis.</p>
<br>
<p>November 25: Breakfast in the hotel, the last of our bagels from the Sedona Safeway.  After breakfast wise lounged around the hotel until 10:30AM. Then we went to the airport for our 2:20PM flight home because we were hungry and hoped to find a place for lunch.  </p>
<br>
<p>Sky Harbor was almost deserted when we arrived.  We were very surprised because this was the day before Thanksgiving.  Our surprise was short-lived however. The airport was as crowded as Kowloon in Hong Kong before we boarded our plane</p>
<br>
<p>Flight back was uneventful and onetime - can’t ask form much else.</p>

<br>
<p>We decided to brave venturing out this Fall to Colorado.  At the time the COVID-19 virus in outback Colorado was almost non-existent.  For example the Pagosa Springs County  had only 59 cases this year.  Steamboat Spring’s  County was a little higher - 152 cases.</p>
<br>
<p>We pretty much stayed away from people wherever we hiked.  The other primary cause of human contact was at restaurants.  Here we were surprised the wearing of masks was universal, unlike our home state of Texas where people seemed to be proud of discarding the mask and exposing themselves as well  as others to the virus.</p>
<br>
<p>We stayed at Wyndham Timeshares in both locations.  Our primary activities were hiking and driving around searching for Fall Color - of which was plentiful.</p>
<br>
<p>We did not  make the trip because of the Fall color but were pleasantly surprised by the masses of color everywhere. </p>
<img class="img90Percent" src="./photos/AspensFall.jpg">
<br>
<h2 id="TL;DR">TL;DR</h2>
<p>September 25:  We flew to Denver and then drove to <b>Steamboat Springs</b>. The drive was uneventful except for the rock striking the windshield of the rental car and cracking the windshield.</p>
<br>
<p>Dinner was at <b>Carl’s</b>.   Because of the COVID 19 virus we had made reservations for every evening meal which turned out to be a smart move. As we arrived at the restaurant the hostess was telling a couple without reservations they had two hour wait for a table</p>
<hr>
<p>September 26: Breakfast this morning was at <b>Creekside Cafe</b>.  39 degrees and a table outside.  Good thing we were prepared and had several layers of clothing.</p>
<br>
<p>Then we drove up the mountain to the <b>Fiddlesticks Trailhead</b>.  Went the wrong direction which was a trail going down the mountain.  After 30 minutes we wised up and marched uphill to the trailhead.  Found the Fiddlesticks Trail and hiked it.   Many aspens and pines all along the trail were downed with the roots pulled out of the ground.  A gentleman we met on the hike told us they had a ferocious storm several weeks back with 100mph guts in the mountains.  Most of us will not be around anymore when the trees have grown back.  But this is <b>Nature’s Way</b>.  Now the small trees have full sunlight and will grow to replace their elders.</p>
<br>
<p>Then back to town for lunch at the <b>BackDoor</b>.  Dined outside. Very good</p>
<br>
<p>In the afternoon we drove along the Elk River past <b>Clark</b> on the lookout for Fall color and we found plenty.  The best was north of Clark.</p>
<br>
<p>Dinner was at the <b>Mahogany Ridge Brewery</b>.  Very good.  We have our favorite places in Steamboat and Mahogany Ridge is one them.  In fact all three establishments today are on the list.</p>
<br>
<p>After dinner back to the Wyndham and watched the <b>Stars</b> win a Stanley Cup game in double overtime.</p>
<hr>
<p>September  27: Breakfast this morning was at <b>Freshie’s</b>.  I was reluctant to go but the meal turned out great.  Another keeper.</p>
<br>
<p>Kept to the condo in the morning and washed clothes.</p>
<br>
<p>Lunch at <b>Creekside</b>. Their lunch is as good as their breakfast.</p>
<br>
<p>Walked the <b>Yampa Core Trail</b></p>
<br>
<p>Dinner at <b>Mambo</b>, Italian of course, was awesome. Food was the best and the atmosphere was better than at Mazzola’s which has great food also but is in a basement.</p>
<hr>
<img class="img30Percent" src="./photos/elkRiver.jpg">
<p>September  28: We checked out of the condo and drove from Steamboat to <b>Pagosa Springs</b> in Southern Colorado.  During the trip we crossed the Colorado River, the Arkansas River, and the Rio Grandes as well as the Continental Divide at least twice driving from Steamboat Springs to Pagosa Springs.</p>
<br>
<p>For lunch during the drive South, we stopped in Buena Vista at the <b>Simple Eatery & Spoon it Up</b>. The restaurant has a strange name but serves up delicious fare.  It is also a bakery.  Buena Vista natives must love bread. It’s a small town but I counted at least two other bakeries.</p>
<br>
<p>After arriving in <b>Pagosa Springs</b> we shopped for dinner at the local City Market and had dinner at the condo while watching the Stars lose the Stanley Cup.  They definitely played above expectations this year.  No experts picked them to get this far.</p>
<hr>
<p>September 29:  Breakfast at the condo</p>
<br>
<p>This morning we took a beautiful drive into the mountains and saw some gorgeous Fall Color.</p>
<br>
<p>We had lunch at <b>Colorado Roadhouse</b>. Food was not bad but the servers were terrible.  They obviously did not want to be there.  Plus, they all wore their face masks hanging off one ear.   DON’T EAT THERE!!!</p>

<br>
<p>Then we drove out to the Opal Lake Trail and started up it.  Bad idea after a glass of wine for lunch.</p>
<br>
<p>We had dinner in the condo again.  There are many breakfast and lunch restaurants here but not many dinner establishments and most of them are not good.</p>
<hr>
<p>September 30: Breakfast at the condo.</p>
<br>
<p>We hung out at the condo this morning.  Gwen washed clothes and Marv worked on Master Gardener tasks and read.</p>
<br>
<p>Lunch at the Condo again.  Are you recognizing a pattern here?  Most of our meals in Pagosa are at the Condo.  </p>
<br>
<p>After lunch we hiked the <b>Coyote Hill Trail</b>.</p>
<br>
<p>Dinner at <b>Alley House Grill</b>.  Dinner here is almost worth the trip to Pagosa. I told Gwen we should eat here every night we are in town but she demurred.</p>
<hr>
<p>October 01: Breakfast at the. Condo</p>
<br>
<p>Washed clothes and hung out in the Condo in the morning.</p>
<br>
<p>Lunch at <b>Lone Spur Cafe</b> in Pagosa.  Just opened. Has decent fare. Would be mediocre in McKinney but is great here.</p>
<br>
<p>After lunch we drove to <b>Durango</b> and strolled around downtown.</p>
<br>
<p>Bought a book - <i>Talking to the Ground</i> at <b>Maria’s Bookstore</b>. Maria only allows 8 customers in the store at a time.  As you enter you have to sanitize your hands.  Felt pretty safe there.</p>
<br>
<p>After the bookstore we walked the <b>Animas River Trail</b></p>
<br>
<p>Before driving back to Pagosa we had dinner at <b>Elous</b>. ‘Twas very good.</p>
<br>
<p>Durango is 54 miles but several galaxies distant from  Pagosa.  There are many good restaurants in downtown Durango.  Pagosa has one - <b>Alley House Grill</b>.  There are many shops in downtown Durango.  Downtown Pagosa has the Hot Spring and not much else</p>
<hr>
<p>October 02: we drove to Denver. Staying the night at a Residence Inn on Tower Road close to the Airport.  Dinner in the room while watching the MLB playoffs.</p>
<br>
<p>We detoured for lunch to Buena Vista to eat at the <b>Simple Eatery</b> again.</p>
<hr>
<p>October 03: We flew home.  We had an early flight so no breakfast just grabbed something quick at the Airport.</p>

<h1 id="Talking to the Ground">Talking to the Ground</h1>
<h4>November 14, 2020</h4>
<p><span class='hashtag'>#book</span> <span class='hashtag'>#Southwest</span> </p>
<br>
<p><i>Talking to the Ground</i> by Douglas Preston (published 1995).   As per my habit of purchasing a book at a local bookstore while on vacation I bought <i>Talking to the Ground</i> at <b>Marias Books</b> in <b>Durango Co.</b></p>
<br>
<p>Summary: In 1992 author Douglas Preston, his girlfriend, and her daughter rode horseback across 400 miles of desert in Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. They were retracing the route of a Navajo Creation Legend where  the deity, Monster Slayer, traveled through this area on his quest to restore beauty and balance to the Earth. </p>
<br>
<p>The trio travel on horseback and camp through four hundred miles of trails, beginning at Navajo Mountain, Utah, traveling on through Monument Valley, across the Utah Strip and Chinle Valley, and on to Canyon de Chelly, the Lukachukai Mountains, ultimately to finish in Shiprock, New Mexico. </p>
<br>
<p>Throughout their journey they encounter interesting people, mostly Navajo,  who share their story all the while weaving in the legend of the Monster Slayer.  </p>
<br>
<p>They also ponder greatly on the fate of the great mystery of the Southwest - <b>Why did the Anasazi Disappear?</b> Navajo legends paint the Anasazi as a people not living in harmony with Nature which ultimately led to their downfall but reveal little else?</p>
<br>
<p>What do archeologists think?  </p>
<ul><li>Extended Drought - Some experts believe and extended drought before and during the time the Anasazi abandoned their cliff dwellings caused them to migrate.  On major problem with this theory is there was a longer  drought  years before that did not drive them away
</li><li>Marauding Raiders - Another theory, put forward by early explorers, speculated that nomadic raiders may have driven the Anasazi out of their homeland. However there is no evidence of this
</li><li>Internal Strife - War among the different cliff dwellings  resulting in even cannibalism 
</li><li>A better place to be:  From the Smithsonian July 2003 issue by David Roberts:
</li></ul>
<blockquote>Archaeologists now generally agree about what they call the “push” that prompted the Anasazi to flee the Four Corners region at the end of the 13th century. It seems to have originated with environmental catastrophes, which in turn may have given birth to violence and internecine warfare after 1250. Yet hard times alone do not account for the mass abandonment—nor is it clear how resettling in another location would have solved the problem. During the past 15 years, some experts have increasingly insisted that there must also have been a “pull” drawing the Anasazi to the south and east, something so appealing that it lured them from their ancestral homeland. Several archaeologists have argued that the pull was the Kachina Cult. Kachinas are not simply the dolls sold today to tourists in Pueblo gift shops. They are a pantheon of at least 400 deities who intercede with the gods to ensure rain and fertility. Even today, Pueblo life often revolves around Kachina beliefs, which promise protection and procreation.</blockquote>
<p>In the final reckoning maybe the Navajo  were correct that the <b>Ancient Ones</b> did not live in harmony with nature and that caused their destruction.  Does that remind you of today?</p>

<h1 id="The Brother Gardeners">The Brother Gardeners</h1>
<h4>August 15, 2020</h4>
<p><span class='hashtag'>#blog</span> <span class='hashtag'>#landscape</span> </p>
<br>
<p>If you are a gardener and can read you will probably be interested in <i>The Brother  Gardeners: Botany, Empire and the Birth of an Obsession</i> by Andrea Wulf. brings to life the dramas and dangers of eighteenth-century plant collecting.</p>
<br>
<p>Andrea Wulf  could probably write and interesting autobiography.  She was born India and moved to Germany as a child. She trained as a design historian at the Royal College of Art  in London.  However she chose  to make a career of writing Botany and Gardening Books.  This is the  third book of her’s I’ve read.  They were all delightful and interesting books which brought to life  Gardening in the past and how we came to where we are today.  The other books I’ve read which I heartily recommend are:</p>
<br>
<ul><li><i>Founding Gardeners: The Revolutionary Generation, Nature, and the Shaping of the American Nation</i>
</li><li><i>The Invention of Nature: Alexander Von Humbolt’s New World</i>
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>In  <i>The Brother Gardeners</i>   the author documents the rise of the Gardening Hobby in England led by a small group of 18th century naturalists that made England a nation of gardeners.  The main characters:</p>
<br>
<ul><li>John Bartman
</li><li>Philip Miller
</li><li>Peter Collinson
</li><li>Carl Linnaeus
</li><li>Daniel Solander
</li><li>Joseph Banks
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>The book is an easy read. The author’s style keeps you interested.  The following is some highlights of each of the main characters:</p>

<br>
<h3 id="John Bartram">John Bartram</h3>
<br>
<p>American farmer who shipped literally tons of plants and seeds to England over the years  </p>
<br>
<p>Bartram traveled far and wide from Virginia to New York’s Catskills To collect specimens for Collinson and the English subscribers to his shipments</p>
<br>
<h3 id="Philip Miller">Philip Miller</h3>
<br>
<p>Miller was a lowly nurseryman who, for much of his professional life, managed the quasi-medical Physic Garden in Chelsea. </p>
<br>
<p>Created the first Gardeners Dictionary <i>The Gardener’s Dictionary</i>. As a result he was voted into the <i>Royal Society</i></p>
<br>
<h3 id="Peter Collinson">Peter Collinson</h3>
<br>
<p>Collinson was a wealthy merchant whose own story cannot really be separated from that of his New World business partner, John Bartram.</p>
<br>
<p>Peter was the recipient of Bartram’s parcels and an avid gardener.  He organized the group of English Gardeners who paid for and shared Bartram’s plants and seeds  </p>
<br>
<p>Collinson was the glue that held this extraordinary group of Gardeners and Botanists together.   </p>
<br>
<p>He and Bertram although they never met each other in person became the closest friends and grew old together.  </p>
<br>
<p>He was the first to die in 1768</p>
<br>
<h3 id="Joseph Banks">Joseph Banks</h3>
<br>
<p>His return from Endeavour's transglobal expedition turned Banks into an overnight sensation with the 18th-century equivalent of rockstar status. Aided by his great Swedish friend and collaborator, Daniel Solander, and backed by huge wealth based on estates in Lincolnshire, Banks became the pivot on which revolved the entire British botanical establishment.    </p>

<p>He also became President of the Royal Society which he held for over 40 years.  He did much to spread the knowledge of Botany throughout the World and to make the Sun never set on the British Empire  </p>
<br>
<p>His accomplishment spread out far from Botany.  For example he imported Spanish Sheep, breed them with English sheep, and exported them to Australia.  They became the famed Merino Sheep.</p>
<br>
<h4 id="Endeavour">Endeavour</h4>
<p>The ship manned by Captain Cook and his crewed sailed around the World.   </p>
<br>
<p>The voyage lasted from 1768 to 1771.  </p>
<br>
<p>Two goals: observe the Transit of Venus in Tahiti and discover the fabled Great Southern Continent.    </p>
<br>
<p>Transits were needed in order to calculate the distance of the Earth from the Sun  </p>
<br>
<p>Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander sailed with the Endeavor  to search out fauna and flora.  They were allowed on the voyage because Banks in large part financed the trip.  </p>
<br>
<p>Main stops were:  </p>
<ul><li>Rio  
</li><li>Tierra Del Fuego  
</li><li>Tahiti
</li></ul>
<br>
<h3 id="Carl Linnaeus"> Carl Linnaeus</h3>
<br>
<p>Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician who formalized binomial nomenclature, the modern system of naming organisms. He is known as the "father of modern taxonomy  </p>
<br>
<p>His classification method is still used today but at the time was considered scandalous because it was based on the plant’s sex organs - stamens and pistils.    </p>
<br>
<p>Now that we have DNA will we reclassify plants based on DNA?  </p>
<br>
<p>After his tour through Europe he returned to Sweden where he eventually became a professor at the University of Uppsala.  </p>
<br>
<p>While there he used a group of volunteers to collect and classify all plants which he published as the <i>Species Plantarum</i>  </p>
<br>
<p><i>Species Plantarum</i> (Latin for "The Species of Plants") is a book by Carl Linnaeus, originally published in 1753, which lists every species of plant known at the time, classified into genera. It is the first work to consistently apply binomial names and was the starting point for the naming of plant</p>
<br>
<h3 id="Daniel Solander">Daniel Solander</h3>
<br>
<p>Disciple who Linnaeus sent to England. Much to Linnaeus’ dismay he stayed in England and became one of the first employees of the British Museum cataloging Han Sloane’s vast collection of dried plants, insects, and minerals </p>
<br>
<h3>Robert Petre</h3>
<br>
<p>If you are counting Robert is number seven and I said there were only six.  He was like the <i>Candle in the Wind</i> popularized by Elton John.  The book would have included seven but he died at the tender age of 30.</p>
<br>
<p>The Eight Baron of Petre.  He inherited “Thorndon” at the age of 19 and devoted his life to transforming his estate as a showcase to American Plants in England.    </p>
<br>
<p>He was the biggest customer of John Bartram.  His zeal was so intense he even raised large mounds in the Northern part of his Estate to mimic the Appalachians that Bartram had described in great detail  </p>
<br>
<p>Both Miller and Collinson were mentors for Petre.  </p>
<br>
<p>Most unfortunate he died of smallpox at the tender age of 30</p>
