  <h1>1968 the year that changed my life</h1>
<p><span class='hashtag'>#mylife</span></p>
<br>
<img class="img75Percent" src="./photos/riot.png"><p></p>
<p>19608, I was young, single, radical, and living in Chicago on January 1, 1968.  After graduating from DeVry in March I moved to Fort Worth Texas because I had scored employment at General Dynamics there working on the flight line on F111 Inertial Navigation Systems in an area called the Raditation Lab by the locals.  Scary, uneasy name for someone’s work environment . Although General Dynamics employed over 20,000 people I worked in an isolated are with 3 other people with no radiation thankfully.  </p>
<br>
<p>The 1960s was a decade of massive change and great unrest.  1968 was the decade’s climax:</p>
<br>
<p>1968’s major disruptive events included:</p>
<ul><li>Vietnam Tet Offensive
</li><li>Vietnam My Lei massacre
</li><li>Martin Luther King assassination 
</li><li>The Cities Burn: Rioting in the streets - 1967 was the Summer of Love. 1968 was the Summer of Rage
</li><li>Civil Rights Act of 1968 forbid housing discrimination
</li><li>Bobby Kennedy assassination
</li><li>The Prague Spring is crushed by 200,000 Eastern Block troops led by the USSR. Yes mama, the Cold War is still alive and well in 1968. But we have God on our side.
</li><li>Black Panther was a terrorist organization, not a action movie
<ul><li> John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised black fist salute during National Anthem at the Mexico City Olympics produces and out roar across the Nation
</li></ul></li><li>Richard Nixon elected President
</li><li>Saddam Hussein becomes Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Council in Iraq after a coup d'état.
</li><li>Star Trek TV series airs the first televised interracial kiss.  Seems unworthy to be on the list but in 1968 it was massively shocking
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>1968 was not all bad:</p>
<ul><li>2001, A Space Odyssey premiers
</li><li>Gold Standard repealed
</li><li>S&amp;P breaks the 100 point ceiling 
</li><li>Intel is founded
</li><li>Boeing introduces the 747
</li><li>Apollo 8 is the first manned spacecraft to orbit the moon
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>It’s impossible to know the road I would have traveled but for certain life would have turned out vastly different sans 1968.  </p>
<br>
<p>I turned down employment in Indianapolis and the Chicago area because I wanted to experience John Wayne country (Fort Worth). Boy, was I surprised North Texas was not much different than Western Illinois where I grew up - just a little hotter and without the corn and hogs.</p>
<br>
<p>I arrived in Fort Worth in March.  Work was pretty boring.  When a F111 arrived at the lab we calibrated the navigation systems in about 8 hours leaving plenty of time to play spades, hearts, and a myriad of other card games.  From time to time we tried to catch armadillos but never succeeded.  They were amazingly quick creatures.  Calibrating an Australian F111 was always a highlight because a couple of Aussie Air Force personnel would shadow their planes. These guys were a crazy, fun loving mob!</p>
<br>
<p>Time rolled on; by the middle of August I was convinced the area was uninhabitable.  The temperature reached 100 everyday. Rain was totally forgotten in this Land That Never Rains.  The landscape to the horizon was brown. Whatever possessed people to abide here?  </p>
<br>
<p>Then came December-January and I was hooked.  T-shirts, shorts, and sandals were commonly seen in the streets.  It never froze. There was no snow!  Holly Tamale, I’m staying!</p>
<br>
<p>I, and the Planet survived 1968 and I decided to remain in Texas.  And time moves on.</p>

<h1>Leonardo</h1>
<p>By Walter Issacson </p>

    <p><span class='hashtag'>#book</span> <span class='hashtag'>#genius</span> <span class='hashtag'>#lessonsforliving</span></p>

<p>Over the course of the millennia there are but a handful of true geniuses.  Newton, Einstein, Bach, Galileo, Euler, Ramanujan, Ford, Herschel, and maybe Musk to name a few. However, none stand any taller than Leonardo, a true polymath!</p>

<p>Leonardo is not the most spell binding book because it concentrates on his engineering, nature, human anatomy, and last but not least artistic talents. We know Leonardo because of the Mona Lisa and a few other paintings but his overriding avocation was the study of everything which he practiced relentlessly.</p>

<p>Leonardo should inspire all of us to stretch a little farther and try a little longer in all of our endeavors.</p>

<p>Take always from Leonardo: </p>

<ul>
<li>Leonardo was curious about everything and studied it relentlessly </li>
<li>His main avocation was to seek knowledge of everything </li>
<li>He detail oriented.  He would have been great at writing iCDs</li>
<li>He never ceased to question  established theories. Instead he devised experiments to test the theories and discovered many of them were invalid.</li>
<li>He documented everything in his journals from autopsy results to shopping lists.  In fact we know so much about Leonardo because of his journals. Incidentally, we only know of his discoveries because of his journals many of which lay unnoticed for 100s of years.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, the book documents the life of one of the few true geniuses of the millennium.  Not a book to read for spell binding action or blushing expose. A book to inspire you to strive for excellence.</p>

<h1>The Burn</h1>
<p><span class='hashtag'>#blog</span> <span class='hashtag'>#travel</span> <span class='hashtag'>#family</span></p>
<br>
<p>I’ve a sad tale for today. Last Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Gwen and I were on holiday in NOLA.  We arrived Christmas Day and had a fun couple of days discovering new restaurants, and exploring the town.  And then the fun ended.</p>
<br>
<p><b>After a great day we were back in our condo and making hot tea.   About 9PM I was making a cup of hot tea, a habit I picked up in Australia. When somehow the cup slipped out of my hand an I poured boiling water all down my left leg.</b></p>
<br>
<p>Luckily Gwen is a nurse. She threw me in a cold shower while she found the ice machine. I spent the next two hours with bags of ice on my left leg from the crotch to my knee. <mark>Yes, the leg hurt like hell!</mark> I was shivering uncontrollably which my nurse wife said was normal as I was going into shock.</p>
<br>
<p>After she made sure I was going to survive she walked a block to the local drug store and picked up supplies to treat the leg. She wanted me to see our doctor instead of going to an emergency room in a strange city.  Therefore we spent our last night in NOLA trying unsuccessfully to sleep.</p>
<br>
<p>Early Thursday morning we drove home and visited the doctor. I am now taking treatments at home which consists of lukewarm baths and a salve to inhibit infection. The doctor tells me it will take a month to heal since they were only <mark>2nd degree burns</mark> - I would have to have skin grafts if they were 3rd degree so I'm really lucky.</p>
<br>
<p>The next couple of weeks at least I expect to sit a home in my underwear watching tv and reading because I have to leave the wound open to heal. I was also lucky because my left leg is the one I burnt as a child and half of the wound is on the scar. No nerve ending according to the doctor so the pain is much less and hey that leg has a scar already.</p>

    <figcaption>My 911</figcaption>
</figure>  

<p>We all survived another year.  2017 was another busy year as they all seem to be. Oh, to be sitting a home bored again!!</p>
<br>
<p>The World was busy also. My top ten events/stories of the year:</p>
<ul><li>Fires, Winds, & Rain of Biblical Proportions: Wildfires are destroying California. Harvey dumped record rainfall on Houston, and 1/3 of Bangladesh was under water.
</li><li>LIGO and Virgo announced they had measured <b>Gravitational Waves</b> predicted by Eisenstein’s theory of General Relitivity in 1916.
</li><li>The Trump administration worked to reverse climate protections this year, seeking to dismantle the EPA, withdraw from the Paris Accord, and dismantle the Clean Air Act
</li><li><b>Cassini</b> ended an incredible 13 year study of <b>Saturn</b> by diving into Saturn’s atmosphere after finally exhausting its fuel supplu
</li><li>The <b>#metoo</b> movement shocked and disgusted most of us (I must have led a sheltered life employed in the bosom of ESY)
</li><li><b>The Last Jedi</b> was totally brilliant
</li><li>Alabama sent a Democrat to the Senate instead of a pedophile
</li><li>The USA experienced a <b>total solar eclipse</b> and I was there!!  
</li><li><b>Tesla</b> from providing batteries and electric cars to storm ravaged Puerto Rico to announcing an electric 18 wheeler to SpaceX to the Hyperloop
</li><li>*North Central Expressway * officially classified as a parking lot (just kidding)
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>On a personal note there was one life altering event for me. Gwen procured a <b>2014 Porsche 911</b>, bright red with a spoiler, for our 45th wedding anniversary. Now I watch auto racing on the TV incessantly.  </p>
<br>
<p>On the down side the doctor tells me I have high HDL and low LDL which apparently is bad. No more French fries, pizzas, or Max's donuts for me I'm afraid!</p>
<br>
<p>This year our travels found us on both Coasts:</p>
<ul><li>Cale tournament in Colorado Springs & whiteout in Steamboat Springs 
</li><li>Sedona & Grand Canyon Road trip with Paxson
</li><li>West Coast baseball trip with Maverick friends 
</li><li>Boston with Kevin and Trish
</li><li>Eclipse in Portland sandwiched between Seattle & Crater Lake and then Redding visit with Rachel’s family
</li><li>NOLA between Christmas & New Year
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>At home I spent way to much time volunteering for the CCMGATX. I hope to rectify that problem in 2018.  Grandchildren also occupied much of our year from babysitting to cheering them on at sporting events and recitals.  At recitals you cheer quietly.</p>
<br>
<p>Best movie I saw this year: <b>The Last Jedi</b></p>
<p>Best book: <b>The Three Body Problem</b> trilogy by Cixin Liu</p>
<p>Biggest Surprise: 911 in my driveway</p>
<p>Biggest Disappointment:  Trump elected President. Note: If Hillary had been elected she would have been my biggest disappointment </p>
<p>Favorite Day: The Eclipse </p>
<p>Favorite new song: <i>Harlem River Blues</i> by Justin Townes Earle</p>
<br>
<p>If the truth be told it was a very good year! Except of course December 27 9PM in NOLA when I spilled a cup of  boiling hot water on my left leg.</p>

<h1>The Stars are Legion</h1>
<p><span class='hashtag'>#book</span> <span class='hashtag'>#syfy</span></p>
<br>
<p>	<i>The Stars are Legion</i>, a Science Fiction <b>Space Opera</b> by Kameron Hurley takes a different twist from your normal Space Opera.  A few pages in I noticed all the characters were female.  I guess not that strange for a female writer to do so. After all male characters dominated the Science Fiction genre for all of my life - and I’m 71.  Is it a coincidence that the last Science Fiction series I read, <i>Ancillary Justice</i> by Ann Leckie consisted of an all female cast? Both Olivia Butler and Ursula LeGuin have authored superb Science Fiction for years the field has always been dominated by men - until now?</p>
<br>
<p>The know Universe consists of a group of Space Ships or human constructed planets or something else entirely.  We never quite know. The author provides much detail but leaves much more to the imagination.  The <i>Ships</i> (lets just call them that) appear to have a metal frame with organic covering.  The women become pregnant and give birth except on a rare occasion to the parts needed by the ship.  Yes, very different! All the ships seem to be wearing out.  The <i>Lords</i> of each <i>Ship</i> try to conquer other ships and then use the other <i>Ship</i> and it’s populace for re-cycling material to keep their <i>Ship</i> functioning although all the <i>Ships</i> appear to be slowly dying.</p>
<br>
<p>Rarely a woman comes along that can give birth to a normal baby.  These woman are highly prized.  Even more rarely a woman comes along that can give birth to another <i>Ship</i>.  Much of  the story involves searching for such a woman.  Yes, as I said before a very strange book.</p>
<br>
<p>In Summary, the story was not your normal run of the mill Space Opera.  However it may not be as far-fetched as <i>faster than the Speed of Light</i> or <i>Fluid Space</i>. Very interesting and different story. I’d recommend it to any Science Fiction fan.</p>
